Evaluate
•	Overview: Criteria are 1) Cost, 2) Design, 3) Quality, 4) Commercial Strength.  For each criteria describe Objective, Evaluation approach & Scoring
•	Cost
o	Objective: lowest overall cost
•	Design
•	Quality
o	Assembly quality
o	Mitigate logistics risk
o	Other construction factors?
•	Commercials Strength (viability, funding, commercial reliability, bonding, terms, etc)

Design
Score for the fabricator’s design approach:
•	Key elements are: Scope, key assemblies 
•	stay vendor-agnostic (easy to swap fabricators/compete pricing),
•	minimize RFIs/submittals and shop-drawing churn,
•	cut schedule risk (transport, crane, install, inspection),
•	preserve quality at matelines and penetrations,
•	control cost by avoiding bespoke details and late redesigns.
Why this matters: recurring failure modes in modular projects cluster around design–factory interface details (matelines, firestopping, MEP integration, tolerances, logistics) and late shop-drawing conversion—key sources of RFIs, change orders, and delay. (AIA Content, PMC, Build Offsite)

Key Assemblies (what we inspect & how we score it)
1) Structural + Vertical Connections
What good looks like
•	Repeatable corner or shear-wall strategy with published load tables and tolerances.
•	Clear stacking grid + allowable step changes (unit length/width increments).
•	Non-proprietary connectors or documented alternates to avoid lock-in.
Red flags → lock-in / RFIs
•	Proprietary corner posts or connectors with no approved equivalents.
•	Fixed module dimensions that can’t step without redesign.
•	Ambiguous erection tolerances and shim/level details.
Checks
•	Show typicals for: corner/edge, diaphragm continuity, tie-downs, drift joints.
•	Provide tolerance schema (factory + site).
•	Evidence of AHJ pre-check/PC approvals where applicable (e.g., CA DSA). (Department of General Services)
Score (0–5)
•	5 = Open, documented system; alternates allowed; step-grid supported.
•	3 = Mostly standard; minor proprietary bits; limited step flexibility.
•	1 = Proprietary system; fixed grid; unclear tolerances.

2) Floor/Ceiling Fire & Acoustics at Penetrations
What good looks like
•	UL-listed / tested assemblies with pre-engineered details for penetrations (plumbing, electrical, HVAC).
•	Clear methods to maintain 1-hr (or required) rating at matelines and service holes; acoustic flanking control.
Red flags → RFIs/delays
•	“To be engineered by others” for common penetrations.
•	Site-applied firestop left to GC without details.
•	Non-standard field fixes after install.
Checks
•	Provide firestop submittals and tested systems (or engineered judgements) matched to assemblies; identify responsible party (factory vs field). (stifirestop.com, AIA Content)
Score (0–5)
•	5 = Tested details for typical penetrations; clear responsibility; acoustic details included.
•	3 = Rated assembly but partial penetration library; some field engineering.
•	1 = No tested details; field to “figure out.”

3) HVAC & MEP Integration Strategy
What good looks like
•	Vendor-agnostic HVAC routing: e.g., ducted to corridor/attic/shaft outside modules OR standard open-web strategy with coordinated soffits.
•	Riser/shaft conventions documented (wet stacks, electrical risers) with repeatable chase locations.
•	Folded into BIM/LOD expectations for shop drawings.
Red flags → cost creep/RFIs
•	Unique joist types or duct routes that force a single fabricator.
•	MEP clashes deferred to shop stage.
•	No coordination rules for vertical wet walls vs corner shafts.
Checks
•	Typicals for HVAC duct pass-throughs, chase sizes, clearances, access panels; RFI history on recent jobs.
Score (0–5)
•	5 = Multiple workable routing options, documented; no bespoke components required.
•	3 = Works if you follow their way; limited alternates.
•	1 = Custom components; high clash/RFI history.

4) Mateline Waterproofing & Envelope Continuity
What good looks like
•	Standard mateline joint details for façade systems (panelized cladding, WRB, flashings) with tested sequences.
•	Clear air/water continuity from factory to field; temporary protection during transport and set.
Red flags → rework/leaks
•	Site-invented flashing at set.
•	WRB continuity not defined over matelines.
•	No transport weather protection spec.
Checks
•	Detail sheets for WRB laps, flashing at heads/sills, balcony/roof edges; temporary protection plan.
Score (0–5)
•	5 = Proven detail library + install sequence; leak-free track record.
•	3 = Adequate but relies on GC craft; a few known weak spots.
•	1 = Undefined; field improvisation needed.
________________________________________
5) Geometry & Tolerances (Dimensional Flexibility)
What good looks like
•	Step-function flexibility (e.g., ±12" increments) without redesign of chassis or MEP cores.
•	Published stacking and alignment tolerances and fit-up allowance at matelines.
Red flags → price increases/delays
•	Any deviation from “catalog” unit triggers full redesign.
•	No published tolerances; “confirm in shop drawings” pattern.
Checks
•	Tolerance table; examples of step changes implemented without COs.
Score (0–5)
•	5 = Multiple step options; tolerance clarity; minimal redesign penalties.
•	3 = Limited steps; some redesign cost.
•	1 = No flexibility; change = change order.

6) Logistics & Lifting (Transport-Ready Design)
What good looks like
•	Modules sized for route permits with documented staging/crane picks; lift points integrated; deflection/rigging calcs standard.
•	Edge protection and finish protection specs.
Red flags → damage/delay
•	Over-width/over-height requiring escorts without contingency.
•	No standard rigging drawings; cribbing improvised.
Checks
•	Standard pick drawings, transport constraints, escort requirements; route risk notes. (PMC)
Score (0–5)
•	5 = Packaged logistics kit; predictable permits; low damage rate.
•	3 = Works but sensitive to routes/weather.
•	1 = Frequent damage or missed windows.

7) Shop-Drawing Conversion & BIM Protocols
What good looks like
•	Clear LOD targets, model exchanges, and approval workflow aligned to permit set; defined design-freeze gates to limit churn.
•	Proven turnaround SLAs; integrated review checklists.
Red flags → submittal churn/RFIs
•	Ambiguous LOD; late design freeze; heavy back-and-forth with AE.
•	“We’ll figure it out in the shop” culture.
Checks
•	Sample submittal packages; RFI/submittal cycle metrics from last 3 projects; documented design-freeze criteria. (AIA Content)
Score (0–5)
•	5 = Predictable, low-RFI pipeline; aligned with AE/permit set.

8) Regulatory Strategy (Pre-Check/Factory Approvals)
What good looks like
•	Use of pre-checked (PC) designs or prior approvals with AHJs where available (e.g., DSA PC in CA); mapped delta list for deviations.
Red flags → inspection delays

Diagnostic Questions (drop straight into the app)
•	Connections: “Provide standard corner/edge details and allowable alternates. What are vertical/horizontal tolerances?”
•	Fire/Acoustics: “Submit tested assemblies + penetration details; who owns field firestop?”
•	HVAC/MEP: “Show two viable duct routing schemes (outside-module vs open-web). Where are wet stacks?”
•	Matelines: “Provide WRB/air barrier continuity details and set sequence; how are seams protected during transport?”
•	Geometry: “List dimension step options that don’t trigger chassis redesign.”
•	Logistics: “Share standard pick drawings, max module envelope, escort requirements, and damage rate last 3 jobs.”
•	Shop/BIM: “State LOD by discipline, approval workflow, and design-freeze gates; RFI/submittal metrics from last 3 jobs.”
•	Regulatory: “Prior PC approvals? Plan for AHJ interface and inspection regimen.”

Red-Flag Patterns to Watch (map to RFIs/cost/schedule)
•	Proprietary connectors + fixed grids → price lock-in, redesign fees.
•	No tested firestop details → AHJ pushback, installation delays.
•	MEP defined late → shop-drawing churn, field clashes, COs.
•	Undefined mateline WRB → leaks/rework.
•	Oversize modules with no route plan → permit delays and damage risk.
•	No design-freeze gates → endless submittals/RFIs.
(These align with documented modular risk clusters around coordination, logistics, and late design resolution. (PMC, AIA Content, Build Offsite))
