Good fit for modular construction with a high Modular Feasibility score of 4.4/5 based on the six criteria below, with no additional restrictions introduced by modular construction.
Criteria: Score each using a scale of 0-5	Weight	Score	Score Justification
Zoning: 5 = allows target units without any waivers. 0 = not allowed to build fully compliant for state bonus density & other factors.  	20%	4	Score of 4/5 as concessions are required to reduce open space and parking requirements. Modular construction does not introduce any additional waivers or restrictions for this site.
Massing: 5 = No additional constraints caused by modular structure; 0 = Modular does not work for the site.	15%	5	 Score of 5/5 since we can achieve the goal of 124 units and unit mix as the traditional original design. 
Cost: 5 = Modular is 10%+ cheaper than site-built; 0 = Modular is 5%+ more expensive than site-built.	20%	4	$62.7M ($404/sf; $506K/unit.  Prevailing Wage: 1.2% savings over site-built 
Score of 4/5 since modular is cheaper than site-built.  Cost for sustainability enhancements have not been considered at this stage. 
Sustainability: 5 = Project readily supports Net Zero Energy (NZE) and PHIUS with minimal site-built upgrades. 0 = Project not viable for high-performance design or renewable energy integration.	20%	5	Score of 5/5 due to strong alignment with PHIUS and Net Zero Energy goals through modular design. Will require enhancements to foundation, walls, roof, windows, HVAC & lighting in addition to the investment in batteries & solar power.  Although these enhancements are likely to be the same for modular or site built, modular construction can reduce the waste generated & increase installation quality. 
Logistics: 5 =No transportation or setting constraints.  0 = Not possible to reach or set the site.	15%	5	Score of 5/5 due to easy access from the highway and available open space for the staging site. 
Time: 5 = Modular saves over 6 months of construction time.  0 = Modular is the same time as site built.	10%	4	9 months design + construction using modular approach vs 13 months for site built.
Score of 4/5 due to savings of 4 months.
Final Score: Go on Modular if none of the criteria = 0 & weighted average >2.5.	 	4.4	 

Site & Zoning: 
This is a preliminary zoning & code review.  A more complete analysis will be completed during the SmartStart & Entitlement phases.

Sustainability
Summary info for Net Zero (battery + solar panels) & PHIUS along with the building attributes to comply & a likely score.
The project presents a strong foundation for achieving Net Zero Energy (NZE) and PHIUS certification through modular construction. Modular design can support energy efficiency goals by integrating passive design principles, efficient HVAC systems, and photovoltaic-ready roof structures. While some PHIUS-specific components—like under-slab insulation and enhanced air barriers—require site-built execution, the majority of the envelope and systems are compatible with factory-built methods. RaaP/HED’s commitment to sustainable, people-centric design and experience in delivering PHIUS-certified multifamily housing provides confidence that the project can pursue NZE targets with minimal cost and design impact.
